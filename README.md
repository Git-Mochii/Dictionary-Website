# Dictionary-Website

This is a Dictionary website I made using HTML, CSS, and, Javascript.

The purpose of the site is to enable a user to input/type a word and see its meaning, part of speech, and, an example if possible.

How to use the website?
=======================
To use the dictionary, a user simply types a word into an input box and clicks on the search button located on the right end of the input area.
Upon pressing the search button, the word will be displayed below alongside the appropriate meaning, part of speech, and, example if available.

[Word Display Example]

(User inputs 'large')

- Large
- Noun
- //
- An old musical note, equal to two longs, four breves, or eight semibreves.

How does the website operate?
=============================

- HTML structures the whole website
- CSS provides the designs for the elements and colour scheme (Input box, welcome message etc.)
- Javascript runs a dictionary via a free API that contains a large database of words, and also handles errors if the user does not enter a valid word like "adad"
